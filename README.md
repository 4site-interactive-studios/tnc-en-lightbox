# tnc-en-lightbox

> A dependency-free, configurable lightbox library for Engaging Networks pages — behavior-triggered and customizable per campaign.

## What it is

`tnc-en-lightbox` is a single-file, zero-runtime-dependency lightbox built for Engaging Networks (EN) fundraising and advocacy pages. A page editor drops a small global config object on a page, loads one script, and the lightbox auto-instantiates. It waits for a configured behavior trigger — or an explicit API call — before opening, and it respects a per-page display frequency so visitors are not nagged.

The library is intentionally small and non-intrusive: one minified IIFE (`dist/en-lightbox.js`) with all styles inlined, no external runtime dependencies, no runtime network fetches, and no interference with EN form submission.

## Key features

- **Zero runtime dependencies** — enforced by the `no-runtime-deps` contract ([`.agentic/contracts/registry.json`](.agentic/contracts/registry.json)).
- **Single self-contained artifact** — `npm run build` emits one minified IIFE at `dist/en-lightbox.js` with all SCSS inlined; verified by the `bundle`, `no-css-emitted`, and `dist-single-file` contracts.
- **Behavior triggers** — time-on-page, scroll-depth, inactivity, and exit-intent triggers compose with first-to-fire-wins semantics (see [`ROADMAP.md`](.agentic/specs/ROADMAP.md) § "Wave 1 — Triggers").
- **Frequency-capped dismissal** — stores a timestamp in `localStorage` keyed by `location.pathname` (`enlb:shown:${pathname}`), with a configurable `frequencyDays` cap (default 7; `0` = every load). Storage failures fail open and never throw on the host page.
- **Theming presets + token overrides** — `light`, `dark`, `brand`, `forest`, and `sky` presets, plus per-token customization of colors, radius, max-width, and font family through CSS custom properties (`--enlb-*`).
- **Campaign layout** — every preset ships a mockup-faithful 50/50 grid (≈835×475px modal, 42px/800 heading, centered content, 238×56 uppercase CTA, optional `eyebrow` label) that stacks below ~700px; `hideImageOnMobile` (default `false`) hides the stacked image when set to `true`.
- **Accessible by default** — focus trap, Escape-to-close, focus restore on close, non-empty accessible name, background `inert`/`aria-hidden` isolation, body scroll-lock, and motion gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion`; covered by unit tests and the `a11y-audit` / `reduced-motion-guard` contracts.
- **Accessible close × + hover affordances** — the close × is drawn with CSS pseudo-elements for pixel-consistent rendering at a ≥44×44px tap target, with a hover/focus scale (reduced-motion respected); the primary CTA scales on hover/focus too.
- **Style-isolated via Shadow DOM** — the lightbox mounts inside an open Shadow DOM root with a `:host` reset, so host-page CSS cannot cascade in and lightbox CSS cannot leak out. The dialog renders correctly with zero host CSS; customization is exclusively through the documented `--enlb-*` theme tokens.
- **EN-form-safe CTAs** — `cta.action` is the single routing source of truth. `redirect` renders as a native `<a href>`; `close` renders as a `<button>` and records dismissal. `secondaryCta` follows the same rules; `dismissLabel` is always a close button.
- **Cross-browser smoke net** — Playwright smoke specs run against Chromium, WebKit, Firefox, and a mobile viewport in CI (`.github/workflows/cross-browser.yml`).

## Quick start

Add the config and load the built script on any EN page where the lightbox should appear:

```html
<script>
  window.ENLightbox = {
    header: "Join the fight",
    body: "Add your voice to protect the lands and waters we all rely on.",
    cta: { label: "Sign now", href: "#petition", action: "redirect" },
    dismissLabel: "Not now",
    triggers: { frequencyDays: 7, time: 5000 },
  };
</script>
<script src="https://en-assets.tnc.org/en-lightbox.js?v=1.0.0" async></script>
```

The script auto-instantiates from `window.ENLightbox`, arms the configured trigger, and opens the lightbox when the trigger fires. For the full config schema, examples, dismissal behavior, and customization limits, see [`EDITOR.md`](EDITOR.md).

Programmatic control is available on `window.ENLightboxAPI`:

```js
ENLightboxAPI.open()      // manual open (honors frequency cap)
ENLightboxAPI.close()     // close manually
ENLightboxAPI.setTheme({ preset: "dark" })  // re-apply theme at runtime
ENLightboxAPI.getInstance() // current Lightbox instance, or null
```

## Architecture overview

- **Build pipeline** — Vite 8 compiles `src/` TypeScript plus inlined SCSS into one minified IIFE at `dist/en-lightbox.js`. The committed `dist/` artifact is the hosted file.
- **Config seam** — `src/config.ts` declares empty extensible base interfaces (`TriggersConfigBase`, `ThemeConfigBase`, `LayoutConfigBase`) that feature modules populate through TypeScript declaration merging. This keeps the dependency direction clean: the core config never imports feature directories.
- **Singleton lifecycle** — `src/index.ts` exports `init`, `getInstance`, `open`, `close`, `armTriggers`, `disarmTriggers`, `isEligible`, and `setTheme`. Auto-init runs on load when `window.ENLightbox` is present; it instantiates but does **not** open the lightbox.
- **Shadow-DOM isolation** — `src/core/lightbox.ts` mounts the modal in an open Shadow DOM root (`attachShadow`), with the inlined SCSS injected into a scoped `<style>` and a `:host` reset that neutralizes inherited font/color/line-height. Host-page styles never reach the dialog, and the lightbox never leaks styles onto the page.
- **Machine-checked contracts** — `.agentic/contracts/registry.json` defines CI-enforced guarantees: bundle freshness, no emitted CSS, no runtime dependencies, no runtime fetches, single-file distribution, API-surface and config-schema snapshots, bundle-size budget (gzip ≤ 6000 B), reduced-motion compliance, a11y audit, and cross-browser smoke. Generators live under `tools/sdd/`.
- **SDD governance** — `.agentic/AGENTS.md`, `.agentic/WORKFLOW.md`, and `.agentic/REVIEWING.md` define the delivery loop, GATES, independent-review protocol, and spec-coupling rules. Per-wave briefs live in `.agentic/specs/wave-N/`; the master plan is in `.agentic/specs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Development workflow

```bash
npm install                # install dev dependencies
npm run build              # emit dist/en-lightbox.js (single IIFE, inlined CSS)
npm test                   # Vitest unit suite in jsdom
npm run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit (strict)
npm run lint               # ESLint
npm run e2e:install        # one-time: install Playwright browsers
npm run e2e                # Playwright cross-browser smoke suite
npm run contracts:generate # regenerate api-surface + config-schema snapshots
```

SDD gates can be run locally:

```bash
python3 tools/sdd/check_spec_coupling.py --base main
python3 tools/sdd/check_contracts.py
python3 tools/sdd/check_test_coupling.py --base main
python3 tools/sdd/check_learnings_freshness.py --base main
```

## Contributing

This project uses Spec-Driven Development under `.agentic/`. Before contributing code, read [`.agentic/AGENTS.md`](.agentic/AGENTS.md) and [`.agentic/WORKFLOW.md`](.agentic/WORKFLOW.md). Every PR needs an independent reviewer, a `Closes #N` body line, and green CI.

## Releasing & hosting

Releases are automated with [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please). Merging Conventional Commits to `main` opens a release PR that bumps the version and updates [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md); merging that PR tags the release and publishes `dist/en-lightbox.js` (carrying a versioned banner) as a GitHub Release asset. There is no npm publish — the editor downloads the versioned artifact from the GitHub Release, uploads it to the Engaging Networks asset library, and cache-busts page embeds with `?v=VERSION`.

The full runbook is in [`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md); per-release hosting and embed steps are in [`EDITOR.md`](EDITOR.md).
